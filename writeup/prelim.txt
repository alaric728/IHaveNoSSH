HEAP OVERFLOWIN'

Similar to the Stack Overflow, Heap Overflows take advantage of actions that can potentially
violate data intregity, such as writing into a buffer or space in RAM without proper bounds
checking, using memory without properly clearing it, or using a file whose name was stored
in dynamically allocated RAM. 
The Heap Overflow is an important and often overlooked security concern, even though they've
been known and well documented vulnerability for a long time, and excellent publications like
w00w00's Heap Overflow and the Malloc Maleficarium, there still seem to be many heap overflow
vulnerabilities that are fairly high profile, and difficult to protect for (RE FREEBSD'S heap
overflow!!!). 
In this paper, I hope to cover a few varieties of the attack, and seek to give a functional
explanation of a few of the techniques of heap overflow, as well as demo's and perhaps even a
few diagrams if I feel up to it :).

PROCEED TO DO THE BASIC HEAP OVERFLOW STUFF
SHOW THE OVERFLOW OF A FILE DESCRIPTOR INTO A GOOD OLE' HEAP OVERFLOW TO DO A WHOIS OR START
SHELL BECAUSE OF SUID

NEXT:
DO A LITTLE BIT MORE SOPHISTICATED, USING EXECUTABLE HEAP

NEXT: 
DO A QUICK RUNDOWN OF THE FREEBSD HEAP OVERFLOW THAT WAS KIND OF A BIG DEAL

It's okay to steal for w00w00 and the malloc maleficarium and such, since they are important
JUST GIVE CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE
